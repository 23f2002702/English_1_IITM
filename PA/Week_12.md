## üìú Passage

> **Throughout the duration of the 1960‚Äôs there was a large propensity for segregation in the South, and this had an effect on many different elements of social life including public restrooms, restaurants and other public areas. This also included the public transportation system, which could be attributed with starting much of the civil rights activism that surrounded the ‚Äúseparate but equal‚Äù distinction that was brought on by Plessy v. Ferguson years prior. Ever since Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat to a white male in 1955, the public transportation system had been a key point in the fight against social injustices based on racial segregation. This all played a part in leading up to the freedom rides of 1961.**
