# English 1 Solutions ✏️

This repository contains my personal collection of weekly notes, assignments, and solutions for the course **English 1** at BS Degree IIT Madras.

---

## 📚 Notes

Inside the `notes` folder, you’ll find topic-wise notes organized by week. These are in pdf format for easy access and readability.

---

## 📝 GA (Graded Assignment) Solutions

All my solutions to the GAs are kept in the `GA` folder, sorted by week. Use them to check your approach — but always try solving on your own first!

---


## 🏋️‍♀️ PA (Practice Assignment) Solutions

Extra practice never hurts! The `PA` folder has solutions to the practice questions for each week. Again, it’s best to attempt them before looking here.
